## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> Currently working on the 'develop' branch

This __research project__ aims to provide a *suitable* and *state-of-art* approaches to *risk management* and *backtesting* in __investment portfolio__.
In particular, through __Deep Reinforcement Learning__ modelling, the research try to offer *insights* on __financial trading scenarios__, capabilities and tecniques designed to maximise profits over the *long-run*.

Currenly, the project is structured in **3 different packages**:
- _models_
    - It defines *modules* and *trading strategies* to operate on the financial markets
    - The __research__ is not focused on this side, we only want to define a *common framework* to streamline thw work 
- _movers_
    - It defines modules to perform *backtesting* in __trading environments__
- *risk_management*
    - It defines the *risk management* __models__
    - The research, as already mentioned, aims to focus on the *risk management*, the model will be __tested__ over different trading environments and, its __performances__ will be integrated and analysed through the models previously defined

More details will be given over the next commits.
